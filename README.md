# Grimworld
In the grim darkness of the far future there is only immortality.

Would make the folder a bit more suitable, but this site apperantly has so much functionality regarding workflow that that would only needlessly complicate things. Have a little look around the site, make an acount. 
i think we will be able to figure this out.

One suggestion i have is regarding perhaps a logbook, tis a habbit i'm getting into. // nevermind, it already has it.

I will try to test some functionality when i start with my c# course.

Also take a look at the projects tab, you prolly have a bit more clue on how to organize that tab. takes a bit of technical knowhow to actually know what we should do.

Much grim verry dark darkness indeed my friend!
