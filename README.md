# Grimworld
In the grim darkness of the far future there is only war.

Would make the folder a bit more suitable, but this site apperantly has so much functionality regarding workflow that that would only needlessly complicate things. Have a little look around the site, make an acount. 
i think we will be able to figure this out.

One suggestion i have is regarding perhaps a logbook, tis a habbit i'm getting into. 
And if you don't find it too much work it's something we could make a file on sometime. 
I will try to test some functionality when i start with my c# course.

Much grim verry dark darkness indeed my friend!
