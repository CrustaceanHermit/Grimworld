Just blurting out some stuff, alot will be out of scope, but atleast tis written down somewhere.


Magical components/ingedients, 
  needed for phalactry construction/ spell casting

Explorable dungeons,
  something like quests in mountainous areas, with perhaps auto generated mountain complexes,
  to find magical components/items. Or just simply the already implemented raider bases with an additional magical stronbox.

Magical items, Rings, amulets, 

Spell casting, 

The procedually generated research tree,
  Perhaps it would be cool too have multiple paths to an end, maybe there is a lich you want to overthrow, and you could do this by becomming 
  another powerfull lich to become the next, or dedicate your self to devine wills.
  
Fitting NPC's
Zombies, skeletons, dark things.?

RPG elements, 
classes, randomized loot, levels, overarching quest or story?

Tech restrictions?
Or are we going to have cyberliches(plz)?
